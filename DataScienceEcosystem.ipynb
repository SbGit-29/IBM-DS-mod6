    "# Throughout this lab, you will be prompted to take screenshots and save them on your device. \n",
    "# You will need these screenshots to upload them as your submission for peer review at the end of this course. \n",
    "# You can use various free screengrabbing tools or your operating system's shortcut keys to do this \n",
    "# (for example, Alt+PrintScreen in Windows and Shift+Command+3 for Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note 1 : Images can be saved with either the .jpg or .png extension.\n",
    "# Note 2: It's recommended to take a screenshot covering the entire content, from the question header to the final output. For markdown cells, capturing only the output is sufficient, there's no need to include the code itself.\n",
